# CUDA Programming Starter Kit

CUDA programming with autocompletion, error-checking, jump-to-definition and quick documentation!

This repo provides basic functionalities for **editing** `*.cu` and `*.cuh` files without the need to install any dependencies (e.g., You don't need to install `nvcc`, `gcc`, `clang`, `msvc`, or any other toolchains). 

If you want to compile, run, and/or debug CUDA programs, please install the CUDA Toolkit from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).
